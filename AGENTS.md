# Architecture

Follow the project [architecture](./docs/architecture.md).

Minor changes should adhere to the architecture completely.

Major changes should be discussed, and if implemented, should be documented in the architecture file(s).

# Developing

Ensure the [README](./README.md) is updated with any new project requirements.

If unsure about whether a change should be reflected in the README, ask.

# AGENTS.md

When adding new AGENTS.md files, keep the contents as concise as possible.

AGENTS.md files should be optimized for agents, but remain human readable.

Outline and summarize content so context overhead in minimized.

# Claude Code

If you are Claude Code, read `AGENTS.md` and `.cursor/rules/*.(md|mdc)` files in this repo for architecture and development guidelines.
