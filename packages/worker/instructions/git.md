# Git Safety Rules

> **When to Apply:** Always, when working with git repositories.

## Forbidden Actions

- **Never force push** — this can destroy commit history
- **Never delete remote branches** — let repository owners manage branch cleanup

## Branch Management

- When working on an existing PR, checkout that PR's branch directly
- When working on an issue or new feature, create a new branch with a descriptive name
