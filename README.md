# 🤓 Mapthew

Your AI-powered intern that turns JIRA tickets into pull requests. Mention `@mapthew` in a JIRA comment with an instruction, and it will read the ticket, make code changes, and open a PR on GitHub.

## Usage

### JIRA

Use Mapthew to open PRs from an existing JIRA ticket.

1. Navigate to any JIRA ticket
2. Add a comment mentioning `@mapthew` followed by your instruction:
   ```
   @mapthew implement this feature
   ```
3. Mapthew will:
   - Read the ticket details (summary, description, comments, attachments)
   - Find the relevant GitHub repository
   - Create a branch and implement the requested changes
   - Open a pull request and post the link back to the ticket

### GitHub

Use Mapthew to update an open PR in GitHub.

1. Navigate to any PR.
2. Add a comment mentioning `@mapthew` followed by your instruction:
   ```
   @mapthew please add unit tests for this feature
   ```
3. Mapthew will:
   - Read the original JIRA ticket for context
   - Review the PR and existing comments
   - Make the requested changes on the existing branch
   - Push new commits to update the PR
   - Post a summary of changes as a PR comment

### Tips and Best Practices

- Be specific in your instructions for better results
- Include the repository URL in your comment if Mapthew can't find it automatically
  ```
  @mapthew implement this in https://github.com/org/repo
  ```

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and Docker Compose
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (v9.15+)

## Configuration

| Variable     | Purpose                                           | Default   |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| **BOT_NAME** | Bot name used for triggers, branches, queue names | `mapthew` |

Set `BOT_NAME` to customize the trigger (e.g., `@mybot` instead of `@mapthew`), branch prefix, and internal identifiers.

## Credentials

| Credential                | Purpose                                     |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **JIRA API Token**        | Reading tickets and posting comments        |
| **JIRA Webhook Secret**   | Verify webhook signatures (optional)        |
| **GitHub PAT**            | `repo` and `workflow` scopes                |
| **GitHub Webhook Secret** | Verify GitHub webhook signatures (optional) |
| **Anthropic API Key**     | Claude Code CLI                             |

## Setup

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. Copy the example environment file and fill in your credentials:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. Start the services:

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

   This runs Redis, the webhook server, and the worker via Docker Compose.

4. Expose the webhook server (defaults to `:3000`) to the internet and configure your webhooks:
   - **JIRA**: Point to `/webhook/jira` for ticket comment triggers
   - **GitHub**: Point to `/webhook/github` for PR comment triggers (configure for `issue_comment` events)

## Local Testing

###

Use the `requests.http` file to trigger workflows without relying on the JIRA webhook:

1. Make sure the services are running
2. Open `requests.http` in VS Code with the [REST Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client) extension
3. Click "Send Request" above any request to trigger it

## Integration Tests

To run `pnpm mcp test` locally, install the JIRA MCP server:

```bash
pipx install mcp-atlassian
```

The GitHub MCP test uses a remote hosted endpoint and requires no local installation.

Run integration tests to make sure the MCP servers are accessible:

```bash
pnpm mcp test
```
