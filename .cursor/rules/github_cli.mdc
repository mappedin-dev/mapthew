Git push and gh CLI commands require `required_permissions: ["all"]` to bypass sandbox restrictions.

The sandbox blocks macOS Keychain access, which prevents credential helpers from retrieving GitHub tokens. Using only `["network", "git_write"]` will fail with credential errors.

For: `git push`, `git pull`, `git fetch`, `gh pr create`, `gh auth`, and similar commands, always use:

```typescript
required_permissions: ["all"];
```
